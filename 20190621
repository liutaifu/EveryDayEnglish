If we're ever gonna truly know one another. I think we Probably have 
to get to know ourselves better first.

1、one another 相互，彼此
   each other
   
   Liz and i have known one another /each other for years. 我和liz相识很多年了。
   
   We will try and help one another. 我们要尽力互相帮助。
   
   We are watching out for one another. 我们在相互照料。
   
   get to do 得去做
   
   you get to know it. 你得了解它。
