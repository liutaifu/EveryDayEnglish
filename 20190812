Life is not the amount of breaths you take. It's the moments that take your breath.
生命的本质不在于你活了多久，而是那些让你怦然心动的时刻。

Heavy lies the crown.
欲戴王冠，必承其重

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is we are powerful beyond measure.
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.
