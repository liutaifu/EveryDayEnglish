The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek. 不入虎穴，焉得虎子。

What the eye can't see, the heart won't grieve over. 眼不见心不烦.

Beatuy is in the eye of the beholder. 情人眼里出西施

You don't speed decades tap dancing on hornet's nests, and not expect to be stung.常在河边走那有不湿鞋。

You can't have a cake and eat it. 鱼和熊掌不可兼得。
