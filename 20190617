Pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, or an hour, or a day,  or even a year, 
but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. 
If I quit, however, it will last forever.

XX will subside
subside verb. 减弱; 消退;
As tears subside, I find it all so amusing.  泪水过后，我发现一切如此轻松自然。
