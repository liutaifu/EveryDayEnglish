None of us really see things as they are, we see things as we are.

None of us 我们中没有人
see things as they are 看清事情的本质.

I must have shown you six or seven paces the last years and every time we get ready to pull the trigger, you pussy out.
I don't pussy out. I just have a lot on my plate.

pussy out 退缩，躲避
pull the trigger  扣动扳机，开枪；下定决心，准备就绪，只欠东风

Everything's ready, what we need to do is pull the trigger. 一切都准备就绪，只欠东风。

I can't go on vacation with you, I still have a lot on my plate. 我不能和你去度假了，我事情还很多。
